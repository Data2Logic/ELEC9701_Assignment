*Info*    Creating Netlist for Point ID (9 1)

Begin Incremental Netlisting Nov 25 11:51:10 2024
WARNING (OSSHNL-226): There are more design variables used in the current netlisting session as
compared to the last session in the current run directory. The netlist(s)
generated in the last netlisting session cannot be reused for incremental
netlisting. Therefore re-netlisting the design.

WARNING (ADE-6003): Terminal "clock", specified in the CDF termOrder, does not exist
           in the cell-view "9701" "comparator" "schematic"
WARNING (ADE-6004): Mismatch was found between the terminals in the cellView and those on the
           termOrder property on the CDF. Because of the mismatch, the CDF termOrder will
           be ignored. The terminals in the cellView will be netlisted in the alphabetical
           order of their names. Eliminate the mismatch if you want the CDF termOrder
           property to be used for netlisting.
           To edit CDF of a cell, 
           i) Open CIW->Tools->CDF->Edit.
           ii) Select Library Name & Cell Name.
           iii) Click on the Edit button in the simulation information section of the
                Edit CDF window.

Simulation design variables differ from those on the cellView,
they have been saved in the file "/tmp/saved-design-variables".
To save future changes, copy variables to cellView before exiting.
